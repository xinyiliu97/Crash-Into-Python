# Crush Into Python 
A python tutorial goes from basic to advanced

## What This Tutorial is For
This tutorial moves relatively fast,
and this is intended to be a "crash course",
which means:
- if you are a good coder and want to learn python fast
  you should be able to fly through this tutorial without much trouble.
  After that you should have some idea about basic porgramming in python.
- if you are a beginner:
  you are going to be confused and have many questions,
  this is **normal** and **intended**, 
  make sure there is a good coder accompanies you through out the tutorial and **ask questions**. 


## Set Up You Need

- Git: https://git-scm.com/ or GitHub desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
- Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ , or even better, anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/ , or even better, pycharm:https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ (community should be enough)


## How Should I Write Code

You need to get a GitHub account, fork this repo.
Then you clone your forked repo to your local,
and pull and push if you need to.

All instructions are here:
https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

**Notice**:
- if you are using Pycharm or VSCode, both of them has builtin git features, that will help you get started a little easier
  - pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html
  - vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support
- if you are using git, not GitHub desktop or the git integration in vscode and pycharm. (I don't know why you want to do that if you are a beginner, but suite yourself.) 
  - on windows, you want to clone the HTTPS link as opposed to SSH link, 
    since there are [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/wiki#how-to-use) that will take care of all the credential management for you.
     It will pop up a login dialogue when you try to push to GitHub. 
  - For other system, you will need to clone the SSL link, and setup ssl for your system:https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
